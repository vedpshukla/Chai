# Chai
Chai Treat Project

Developing and implementing a Python script to automate the process of randomly selecting a team member for the chai treat, ensuring fairness and equal distribution of responsibilities among team members.
Utilized email sending functionality and integrated it with the script to send reminder emails to the selected team member, while also including the rest of the team members in CC, enhancing communication and collaboration within the team.
